#DESCRIPTION OF TASK Objective:  Redesign the WhatsApp Status experience by improving usability and visual clarity through separation of features and UI enhancements.

Description:
As part of an ongoing UI/UX exploration, this project focuses on redesigning the WhatsApp Status feature to enhance user experience and clarity. After conducting initial research and analyzing user interaction patterns, I decided to separate the Status and Channel sections into two dedicated pages, each accessible through distinct, easy-to-recognize icons. This decision was driven by the goal to reduce visual clutter, improve navigation, and give each feature its own space to shine. The redesign maintains WhatsAppâ€™s familiar look and feel while introducing a cleaner, more modern interface with smooth transitions and an improved layout.
